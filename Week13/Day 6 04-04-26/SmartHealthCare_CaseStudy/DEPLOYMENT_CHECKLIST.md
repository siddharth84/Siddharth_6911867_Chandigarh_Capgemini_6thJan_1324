## Deployment Steps

### For Local/Staging Deployment:

1. **Clone/Pull Latest Code**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd SmartHealthCare
   ```

2. **Restore Dependencies**
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Apply Database Migrations**
   ```bash
   cd src/SmartHealthcare.API
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

4. **Verify Configuration**
   - Update connection strings if needed
   - Update API/MVC URLs in configs
   - Set environment variables

5. **Build Solution**
   ```bash
   cd ..\..\
   dotnet build
   ```

6. **Run API**
   ```bash
   cd src/SmartHealthcare.API
   dotnet run
   # API runs on https://localhost:5293
   ```

7. **Run MVC** (in new terminal)
   ```bash
   cd src/SmartHealthcare.MVC
   dotnet run
   # MVC runs on https://localhost:5013
   ```

8. **Verify Accessibility**
   - Open http://localhost:5013 in browser
   - Verify home page loads
   - Test login with: admin@healthcare.com / Admin@123

### For Production Deployment:

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues found:

1. **Stop Applications**
2. **Restore Previous Database Backup**
   ```sql

   FROM DISK = 'C:\backups\SmartHealthCareDB_backup.bak'
   ```
3. **Redeploy Previous Version**
4. **Notify Users**
5. **Investigate Root Cause**

2. **Backup Strategy**: Daily backups recommended
3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for:
   - Application restarts
   - Errors in logs
   - High response times (>2 sec)
   - Failed authentication attempts
4. **Scaling**: If needed, implement caching for doctor list
5. **Support Contact**: __________
