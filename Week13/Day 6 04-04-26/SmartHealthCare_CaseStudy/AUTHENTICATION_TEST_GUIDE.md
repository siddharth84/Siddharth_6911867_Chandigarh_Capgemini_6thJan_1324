# SmartHealthcare Authentication Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide documents all authentication flows that should be tested to ensure the system is fully functional.

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Database should be updated with latest migrations:
   ```bash
   cd src/SmartHealthcare.API
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

2. Both applications should be running:
   - **API**: `dotnet run` in `src/SmartHealthcare.API` → runs on `https://localhost:5293`
   - **MVC**: `dotnet run` in `src/SmartHealthcare.MVC` → runs on `https://localhost:5013`

### Test Credentials
After running migrations with seed data, use these credentials:

| Role | Email | Password | Purpose |
|------|-------|----------|---------|
| Admin | admin@healthcare.com | Admin@123 | System administration |
| Doctor 1 | doctor1@healthcare.com | Doctor@123 | Cardiology specialist |
| Doctor 2 | doctor2@healthcare.com | Doctor@123 | Dermatology specialist |
| Doctor 3 | doctor3@healthcare.com | Doctor@123 | Orthopedics specialist |
| Doctor 4 | doctor4@healthcare.com | Doctor@123 | Pediatrics specialist |
| Doctor 5 | doctor5@healthcare.com | Doctor@123 | Neurology specialist |
| Patient 1 | patient1@healthcare.com | Patient@123 | Test patient (Raj Patel) |
| Patient 2 | patient2@healthcare.com | Patient@123 | Test patient (Anjali Verma) |
| Patient 3 | patient3@healthcare.com | Patient@123 | Test patient (Amit Kumar) |
| Patient 4 | patient4@healthcare.com | Patient@123 | Test patient (Sneha Gupta) |
| Patient 5 | patient5@healthcare.com | Patient@123 | Test patient (Arjun Desai) |

## Troubleshooting

### Login fails with "Invalid email or password"
- Verify user exists in database after seeding
- Check password is hashed correctly
- Ensure database migration was applied

### Token expires immediately
- Check JWT secret key configuration in `appsettings.json`
- Verify token expiry time is set correctly (default: 60 minutes)

### Can't access protected endpoints
- Verify JWT token is included in Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- Check token format is correct (not expired)
- Verify Bearer scheme spelling

### CORS errors
- Verify MVC URL is in API's CORS allowed origins
- Check `Program.cs` CORS configuration
- Ensure credentials flag set correctly in fetch requests

## Logging and Monitoring

Monitor these logs while testing:
1. **API Logs**: `src/SmartHealthcare.API/Logs/` - Check for errors/warnings
2. **Browser Console**: JavaScript errors or network failures
3. **Network Tab**: Verify HTTP status codes are correct

---

## Next Steps After Testing

Once all tests pass:
1. Document any bugs found
2. Fix any failing tests
3. Perform user acceptance testing (UAT)
4. Deploy to staging/production environment
5. Monitor production logs for issues
